# whatsTheWeather
ANDROID STUDIO PROJECT<br><br>
Basic project that enables us to use the available Weather API and help us predict the weather of different cities entered byu the user!<br>
The app implements the concepts of being able to download the web content from online websites and also extract the JSON data that can be manipulated as per the requirements of your app.
<br><br>
The API used is available at api.openweathermap.org website.<br>
